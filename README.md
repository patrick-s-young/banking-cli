# JSON Filter CLI

## Description

`json-filter` is a command-line tool for filtering and querying JSON files using simple CLI arguments. It supports filtering by key-value pairs, partial matches, and date ranges. This tool is especially useful for developers and data analysts who want to quickly extract subsets of JSON data without writing custom scripts.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/json-filter.git
   cd json-filter
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. (Optional) Link globally for easier use:

   ```bash
   npm link
   ```

## Development and Testing

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (version 18+ recommended)
* npm

### Local Setup

To run the CLI locally without linking:

```bash
npx tsx src/index.ts --help
```

Or run it via a script defined in `package.json`:

```bash
npm run start -- --help
```

### Running Automated Tests

1. Make sure all dependencies are installed:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Run tests using:

   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

3. The test suite uses Jest and includes unit tests for key CLI functions like parsing arguments, applying filters, and reading/writing files.
